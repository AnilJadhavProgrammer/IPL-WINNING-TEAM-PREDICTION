# IPL-WINNING-TEAM-PREDICTION
**Introduction**

This project aims to predict the winning team of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using historical data. The project involves data analysis, feature engineering, and applying machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

**Datasets**

The project uses three primary datasets:

**matches.csv**: Contains details of IPL matches such as teams, winners, scores, and other match-related information.

**most_runs_average_strikerate.csv**: Contains player statistics including total runs, average, and strike rate.

**teams.csv**: Contains information about the IPL teams.

**Project Structure**

The project is organized into the following sections:

**Data Import and Preparation**: Loading and initial exploration of the datasets.

**Data Processing**: Cleaning and merging datasets to prepare for analysis.

**Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features from the raw data.

**Model Building**: Training machine learning models to predict match outcomes.

**Evaluation** : Assessing the performance of the models.

**Installation**

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

**NumPy, 
pandas, 
scikit-learn, 
matplotlib (optional for data visualization)**

You can install these libraries using pip:
**pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib**

**Usage**

**Clone the Repository:**
Clone this repository to your local machine.
git clone **https://github.com/yourusername/ipl-winning-team-prediction.git**

**Results**

The project builds and evaluates several machine learning models to predict the winning team. The models' performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
